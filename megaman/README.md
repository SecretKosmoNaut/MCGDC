Hello everyone, my name is Alex and I've been setting up an unofficial repository for a side project that I've been working on yesterday related to Monday's club meeting. It's regarding a Python based game that is made from scratch (less PyGame for image processing). We talked about making a side scroller game, such as Super Mario Bros. clone and a chess board game as ideas. I've gone ahead and started the side scroller, but have used Mega Man as the player character instead of Mario for the proof of concept.

If anyone is interested in programming and likes solving problems from scratch using the concepts we've learned in class, feel free to join me as I continue to work on the side scroller and possibly start working on the chess game as well. The framework/library/module, PyGame, is discussed in our CSC Intro Programming textbook and will be covered during the course. This project will help you gain additional practice outside of class if you need it and I am more than happy to answer any of your questions as they relate to the project. Working on this project will help you with Assignment: Program 03 and your Final.

The side scroller won't strictly be Mega Man per se, I am mainly using sprites that already exist so that I can focus on the programming concepts without being distracted by other areas of game design. Elements from Mario, Metroid etc can and will be added as programming challenges using whatever sprites as place holders.
